This method is used for SQL statements which update the database in some way. For example INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements. All these statements are DML(Data Manipulation Language) statements. This method can also be used for DDL(Data Definition Language) statements which return nothing. For example CREATE and ALTER statements. This method returns an int value which represents the number of rows affected by the query. This value will be 0 for the statements which return nothing.
